# Secure Data Hiding in Images through Steganography (Python)
This project illustrates a straightforward yet efficient method of image steganography with Python and OpenCV. It enables users to safely hide (encrypt) a secret message within an image and then retrieve (decrypt) it with an easy-to-use Tkinter-based GUI.

## Key Features 
### ✅ Data Hiding (Encryption):

Insert a hidden text message into an image by placing each character's ASCII value into the image pixels with a diagonal embedding strategy.
The modified image is saved as a lossless PNG file to ensure data integrity and prevent quality loss.
### ✅ Message Extraction (Decryption):

Extract the concealed message from the encoded image using the proper passcode and message length.
### ✅ User-Friendly Graphical Interface:

Upload a cover image for embedding.
Input a hidden message and assign a passcode. Encrypt the message safely in the image. Upload an encrypted image for message extraction. Decrypt and see the secret message at once. This project makes steganography within reach and coverage, rendering it a feasible alternative for safe communication.

### ✅ Open-Source & Customizable
The project is open source, and users can modify and enhance the steganography algorithm whenever and wherever necessary.

### ✅ Easy Installation & Setup
There is a **requirements.txt** file for easy installation of dependencies.
Detailed README.md directions lead users through installation and usage.

### ✅ Organized Code & Documentation
The code is clean, modular, and best-practice compliant. Includes explanations and comments for clarity.
